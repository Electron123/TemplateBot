# TemplateBot

-----

### Information
- I was kinda bored and saw that my github is empty so I thought about creating this template for anyone who wanna build on top of it, this template probably sucks and there are much better than this.

### Setting up
- Clone the repository using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or using Git by the following command:-
```
git clone https://github.com/Salint/TemplateBot.git
```
- Navigate to the directory and run the command `npm install` to install the needed modules(which is DiscordJS only by the way).
- Edit the `token` property in `config.json` so it matches your Bot's token.
- Start the bot by typing `node .` or `node app.js` through your Terminal.

Enjoy!
